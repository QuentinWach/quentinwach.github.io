title:  "Augmenting Obsidian.md with AI: Automatic Linking, Tagging, and Grouping!"
description: "A simple, free and open Python script to quickly organize your markdown notes in Obsidian.md using OpenAI's large language models. Any random, untagged, empty, or unlinked notes? No more. This little script will fill the gaps, connect what belongs together, and even create high level organizing nodes if a specific topic has a lot of notes. This is very powerful and a lot more features can be thought of."
