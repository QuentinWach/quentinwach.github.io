description: "Being done with lab work and not busy with research either, I spent some time writing short essays on various subjects aiming to ask questions like: _'Is science a young man's game?'_, _'What is the relationship between genius, creativity, and insanity?'_, and _'How can we make academic articles freely accessible?'_"
