title:          "Quester"
description:    "Your solo-levelling assistant for learning anything. Instead of making flashcards for days then studying them in a random and unstructured way, Quester's AI generates a course based on any subject or PDF you feed into it as well as all the flashcards and variants of them you may need. The app then decides which topics to quiz you on not based on each card individually but every card, their context and how they relate to each other. It makes no sense to take a test about quantum mechanics if you don't know linear algebra after all!"
