title:          "Field-Dependent THz Transport Nonlinearities in Semiconductor Nano Structures"
description:    "The charge transport in semiconductor quantum dots and nanorods is studied theoretically, predicting strong field-dependent nonlinear mobility effects and intra-pulse gain. We studied the temperature- and size-sensitive mobility spectra, crucial for applications like 6G tech and nano electronics in general."
