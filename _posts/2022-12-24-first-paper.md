title:          "THz Response of Charge Carriers in Nanoparticles"
description:    "Presenting a new quantum mechanical theory that models the THz mobility of charge carriers in low-dimensional semiconductors, revealing nonlinearities even at low field-strengths as well as a quantum mechanical equilibration current that counteracts the mobility at low frequencies."
