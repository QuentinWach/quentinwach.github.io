Several of my private projects require VLSI of complicated analog and hybrid signal circuits.
Since I am not a trained electrical engineer, finding the appropriate recources for free turned out to be rather difficult. But I eventually settled on learning Verilog AMS and SPICE for this purpose.

I don't know what I don't know yet and as such it may be helpful to look at what companies require from engineers.
Apple for example requires following qualifications to be an analog IC design engineer:

- Deep understanding of analog/mixed-signal design.
- Solid understanding and expertise in crafting analog/mixed-signal circuit blocks including: 
    * ADCs & DACs
    * PLLs
    * DLLs
    * filters
    * bandgap
    * biasing circuits
    * LDO regulators
    * amplifiers
    * comparators
    * switched-cap circuits
    * oscillators
- In-depth knowledge of analog mixed-signal concepts like:
  * mismatch mitigation
  * linearity
  * stability
  * low-power techniques
  * low-noise techniques
- Experience with high-speed digital circuits:
  * serializer
  * de-serializer
  * counters
  * dividers
- Design experience in sophisticated CMOS technologies, design with FinFet technology.
- Hands-on experience with AMS IC development from definition to high-volume production including:
  * layout supervision
  * bench evaluation
  * correlation
  * characterization
- Experience in lab testing of mixed-signal circuits and experience in using:
  * spectrum analyzers
  * oscilloscopes
  * signal generators, etc. to validate analog designs
- Able to build VerilogA/AMS behavioral models, analyze and lead characterization data from lab and volume testing.

To teach all of that and more to myself, I will be using the book _The Designer's Guide to Verilog-AMS_ by Kenneth S. Kundert and Olaf Zinke from Cadence Design Systems in 2004.

The book has around 250 pages in total.
If we work through 10 pages / day, we can be done in a month.
