title:  "PONDER: Semantic Flashcards for 100x More Effective Spaced Repetition Using Knowledge Trees"
description: "Spaced repetition and apps utilizing it have had several fatal flaws with little to no progress in the past few decades. Cards accumulate that are redundant and easy yet performed on poorly even though the student has a good understanding of the subject overall. The algorithm often trains the student on topics he has already mastered. That is because measuring understanding is only done on a card-by-card basis. By generating semantic knowledge trees that relate flashcards to each other, creating a knoweldge graph with cards about a topic linked together, the algorithm can accurately estimate what topics the student understands well and which topics need to be studied further with unprecedented accuracy. This reduces the amount of flashcards needed to be studied by orders of magnitude. All of the code is open source and the app can be downloaded for free."
