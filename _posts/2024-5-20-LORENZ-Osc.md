title:  "LORENZ Chaos Eurorack Synthesizer Module"
description: "A fully analogue computer for music synthesis generating the chaotic dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and visualizing it on an integrated screen. Control the speed of the oscillations with three modes, all the parameters of the attractor and output the X, Y, and Z coordinate signals, and feed in your own signals into the three channels to be modulated chaotically."
