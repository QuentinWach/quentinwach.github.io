This 90-minute lecture is my attempt of distilling a large amount of rather advanced concepts in quantum mechanics down to their essentials. By the end of it, you will have heard of various concepts and fields that are very important in modern physics and motivate you to study them in depth yourself.

### Introduction
**The state of a quantum system** is expressed with the _Ket_-vector
$$
|\psi \rangle \in \mathcal{H}
$$
in the unitary space $$\mathcal{H}$$. What matters is the _direction_. $$|\psi \rangle $$ and $$ |\psi' \rangle = c \cdot |\psi\rangle $$ where $$ c \in \mathcal{C} $$ are equivalent. 
And in the following, $$ \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1 $$.


**Superpositions** are possible:
$$
|\chi \rangle, |\xi\rangle \in \mathcal{H} \Rightarrow |\psi|\rangle = a \cdot |\chi\rangle  + b \cdot |\xi\rangle \in \mathcal{H}.
$$
