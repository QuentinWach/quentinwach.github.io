**Technology enables fundamental progress. Awe inspires altruism. And so we must realize research and engineering ideas that solve the challenging problems of our time while creating hope for a better future.**

**There is a vast gap between the limits imposed onto us by physical law and what we have engineered our world to be. I believe the most moral act is to push applied research and engineering efforts to bridge this gap.**

+ Integrated photonics.
+ Electric engineering fundamentals with a focus on analog computing.  -->

<!--
My work at the Fraunhofer HHI.
+ Creating designs and layouts for photonic integrated circuits using Python, NAZCA, KLayout, and our custom library of building blocks and scripts.
+ Developing new building blocks and modules from the start to finish.
+ Verifying and optimizing arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) using Epipprop and Fimmwave, automating the simulation and analysis process, and creating an easy to use software on a dedicated computer to make it easy for anyone to use and maximize our efficiency within the group.
+ Assembling, checking, and organizing final wafer masks for the tapeout within the group, making sure all the designs would indeed work and be manufactured as intended. 
+ Setting and documenting standards for pretty much all practices including the building block library, Epipprop simulation automation

Work-inspired side projects:
+ Unprompted, I solved the direct routing problem that kept causing errors, delays, and poorly optimized waveguide layouts by implementing and integrating Dubins paths which is the mathematically proven shortest path between two vectors with a given minimum bending radius. This made me known within the entire group overnight.
+ Again unprompted, I also developed, implemented, and integrated a global auto-routing algorithm which is optimized to minimize waveguide losses, crosstalk, save hours if not days of work as well as enable the design of complex heterogenic PIC structures with >1000 components which was utterly unthinkable before. -->

##### Charge Transport in Nanostructures

<!--All of engineering is based on material science and its limitations and many of the most advanced modern technologies are nanotechnologies. That includes computers, solar cells, batteries, sensors, lasers, and so on. It is relevant to understand the material properties of the nanoscopic structures they utilize. -->


Structures within our computer processors, solar cells, lasers, batteries etc. are so small that electrons often behave like quantum mechanical waves rather than particles making their behavior much more difficult to predict and understand. It is also extremely difficult to even measure the material properties of nanostructures. You can't really hold a probing needle on a particle 10.000x smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Using THz spectrosopy to probe the conductivity of nanoparticles is an essential new tool. And making sense of that physics, quantum mechanically, is what the majority of my research in the past has been focusing on.

##### Photonic Integrated Circuits
Lithography techniques now allow us to reduce large, complicated, thus costly and time-consuming optical setups down to chips only a few mm in size. Such photonic integrated circuits are also essential for quantum computing, the quantum internet, and essentially all modern communication / data transmission technologies. Still, creating them comes with a lot of exciting challenges as the field is still very young compared to that of integrated _electronic_ circuits. Personally, I think a lot about **photonic design automation** (How can we design PICs better and faster?)

* [(July, 2024) IC3D: Creating 3D Animations from Complex Photonics .gds-Files](https://quentinwach.com/science-engineering/2024/07/24/IC3D.html)


I have been part of more than five [tape-outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape-out) so far, creating up to 50% of all the designs on it as well as the overall wafer layout, ensuring that all designs are indeed functional, establishing and enforcing design standards, developing new building blocks to be used within our group, and running and automating large simulations.

##### Computing
AI research is not only the fastest moving field of science today but promises to end the need of human involvement for scientific discoveries itself. This global race for AGI and super intelligence has sparked another fundamental revolution in computer hardware and architecture. That includes non-traditional, "exotic" approaches like neuromorphic computing, photonic computing, a revitalization of analog computing, quantum computing, thermodynamic computing, reversible computing, ... We are experiencing a new Cambrian age of computing and I âm working to contribute my share. I keep some updated of related projects public on my science and engineering projects page including:

### Simulations & Programmatic Visualizations
I like to model, simulate, and visualize complex and chaotic physical systems both for work as well as a hobby. For some time, I regularly shared simple animations online that have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter and Reddit.

Due to popular demand, I also created (from scratch) a [website to teach students how to create scientific figures and animations with Python for free](https://quentinwach.com/Animating-Science):

**Art & Music.**
I was born into the world of art and quickly made a career out of it from a young age (selling drawings, commission paintings, and performing as a pianist, producing music for indie movies, videos, and games). Yet, since I wanted or rather needed to make myself truly useful, I left that career trajectory at the age of 18, left my home city, and went into science and engineering. Still, once or twice a year, I may still sit down for an hour or two to draw, paint, sculpt, and play something on one of many musical instruments. What will always last, is the desire to create and my strong entrepreneurial spirit.

Read my short story about [why I switched from art to science.](https://quentinwach.com/biography,/story/2024/02/10/Who-am-I.html)
