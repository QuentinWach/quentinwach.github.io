<!--
My work at the Fraunhofer HHI.
+ Creating designs and layouts for photonic integrated circuits using Python, NAZCA, KLayout, and our custom library of building blocks and scripts.
+ Developing new building blocks and modules from the start to finish.
+ Verifying and optimizing arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) using Epipprop and Fimmwave, automating the simulation and analysis process, and creating an easy to use software on a dedicated computer to make it easy for anyone to use and maximize our efficiency within the group.
+ Assembling, checking, and organizing final wafer masks for the tapeout within the group, making sure all the designs would indeed work and be manufactured as intended. 
+ Setting and documenting standards for pretty much all practices including the building block library, Epipprop simulation automation

Work-inspired side projects:
+ Unprompted, I solved the direct routing problem that kept causing errors, delays, and poorly optimized waveguide layouts by implementing and integrating Dubins paths which is the mathematically proven shortest path between two vectors with a given minimum bending radius. This made me known within the entire group overnight.
+ Again unprompted, I also developed, implemented, and integrated a global auto-routing algorithm which is optimized to minimize waveguide losses, crosstalk, save hours if not days of work as well as enable the design of complex heterogenic PIC structures with >1000 components which was utterly unthinkable before. -->

<!--All of engineering is based on material science and its limitations and many of the most advanced modern technologies are nanotechnologies. That includes computers, solar cells, batteries, sensors, lasers, and so on. It is relevant to understand the material properties of the nanoscopic structures they utilize. -->
<p>Structures within our computer processors, solar cells, lasers, batteries etc. are so small that electrons often behave like quantum mechanical waves rather than particles making their behavior much more difficult to predict. Since it isn’t possible to hold a probing needle on a particle 10.000x smaller than the diameter of a human hair, using THz spectrosopy is an essential new tool to probe the conductivity of nanoparticles. Making sense of that physics, quantum mechanically, is what the majority of my research in the past has been focusing on.</p>

<p>Lithography techniques now allow us to reduce large, complicated, thus costly and time-consuming optical setups down to chips only a few mm in size. Such photonic integrated circuits are essential for computing and modern communication / data transmission technologies. Still, creating them comes with a lot of exciting challenges as the field is still very young compared to that of integrated <em>electronic</em> circuits. Personally, I think a lot about <strong>photonic design automation</strong> (How can we design PICs better and faster?)</p>

##### AI
AI research is not only the fastest moving field of science today but promises to end the need of human involvement for scientific discoveries itself. This global race for AGI and super intelligence has sparked another fundamental revolution in computer hardware and architecture. That includes non-traditional, "exotic" approaches like neuromorphic computing, photonic computing, a revitalization of analog computing, quantum computing, thermodynamic computing, reversible computing, ... We are experiencing a new Cambrian age of computing and I âm working to contribute my share. I keep some updated of related projects public on my science and engineering projects page including:

### Simulations & Programmatic Visualizations
I like to model, simulate, and visualize complex and chaotic physical systems both for work as well as a hobby. For some time, I regularly shared simple animations online that have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter and Reddit.

Due to popular demand, I also created (from scratch) a [website to teach students how to create scientific figures and animations with Python for free](https://quentinwach.com/Animating-Science):

**Art & Music.**
I was born into the world of art and quickly made a career out of it from a young age (selling drawings, commission paintings, and performing as a pianist, producing music for indie movies, videos, and games). Yet, since I wanted or rather needed to make myself truly useful, I left that career trajectory at the age of 18, left my home city, and went into science and engineering. Still, once or twice a year, I may still sit down for an hour or two to draw, paint, sculpt, and play something on one of many musical instruments. What will always last, is the desire to create and my strong entrepreneurial spirit.

Read my short story about [why I switched from art to science.](https://quentinwach.com/biography,/story/2024/02/10/Who-am-I.html)
